Screen shots folder contains all the screendumps
Waypoints folder contains all the waypoints generated for the goal points in assignment
For someof the waypoints the wavefront was working perfactly but the robot wasn't going to the goal point properly as there were too many waypoints and i think robot was overshooting them.That's why it was running in round fashion and wasn't goint to the subgoals.Although the same wavefront path was properly followed when inbuilt goto function was used .
